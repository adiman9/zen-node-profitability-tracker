# ZenCash node profitability tracker

This is a simple script that will pull in necessary data and calculate the profitability of zen super nodes and zen secure nodes respectively.

I have this running periodically to track the profitability of each type of node over time so I can know which nodes I should be running at any given time.

The script also tracks the number of nodes that are up / down at any given point as well as zen price. This is interesting data to have collected over time.
